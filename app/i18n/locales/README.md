**Note**: `defaultMessages.json` is a file automatiaclly generated by `npm run manage-translations`. We include it in the build system because not doing so would cause every CI build to have to build twice in the following way:

1) `npm run build` (this will construct the translation cache)
2) `npm run manage-translations` (will build the defaultMessages.json)
3) `npm run build` (to this time include the default messages in the build)

This is something that could be improved in the future.
